# The neural representation of visually evoked emotion is high-dimensional, categorical, and distributed across transmodal brain regions

This repository contains the data and code for replicating results in our paper: [Horikawa, Cowen, Keltner, and Kamitani (2019) The neural representation of emotion is high-dimensional, categorical, and distributed across transmodal brain regions. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/872192v1.abstract).
We investigated the neural representation of visually evoked emotions using fMRI responses to 2185 emotionally evocative short videos generated by Alan S. Cowen and Dacher Keltner (PNAS, 2017).


## Data (fMRI data and features)

- The preprocessed fMRI data for five subjects and ratings/features (category, dimension, visual object, and semantic) will be available at <http://figshare>.
- The fMRI data will be saved as the [BrainDecoderToolbox2](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/BrainDecoderToolbox2) format.
- The unpreprocessed fMRI data will be available at [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002425).

## Video stimuli

- We used 2185 emotion evocative short videos collected by Cowen and Keltner (2017).   
- You can request the videos with emotion ratings from the following URL (https://goo.gl/forms/XErJw9sBeyuOyp5Q2).
